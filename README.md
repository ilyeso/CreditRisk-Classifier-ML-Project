# DefaultClientMachineLearning
Predict credit card default of clients Study the case of customers default payments and compares the predictive accuracy of probability of default using various methods : KNN, Logistic Regression, DA, NB, ANN, CT
In recent years, the credit card issuers in Taiwan faced the cash and credit card debt crisis and the delinquency is expected to peak in the third quarter of 2006 (Chou, 2006). In order to increase market share, card-issuing banks in Taiwan over-issued cash and credit cards to unqualified applicants.
This project falling under the field of crisis managment is therefore aimed at solving this problemetic by predicting the probability of default payment by credit card holders.

"The comparisons of data mining techniques for the predictive accuracy of probability of default of credit card clients" written by I-Cheng Yeh from the Department of Information Management of Chung-Hua University (Taiwan) and Che-hui Lien from the Department of Management of Thompson Rivers University (Canada) in 2009 aimed at the case of customers default payments in Taiwan and compares the predictive accuracy of probability of default among six data mining techniques (discriminant analysis, logistic regression, Bayesclassifier, nearest neighbor, artificial neural networks, and classification trees) and their applications on credit scoring. This dataset contains also information on default payments, demographic factors, credit data, history of payment, and bill statements of credit card clients in Taiwan from April 2005 to September 2005.
